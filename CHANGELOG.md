# Changelog

## 0.9.0-beta

First feature-complete build. Everything described in
[`docs/PHASE1-PLAN.md`](docs/PHASE1-PLAN.md) is implemented, but nothing has
been run in the game yet, so this is a beta rather than a 1.0.

**Presets**
- Named rule presets with health by armor class, roll thresholds, criticals,
  damage, turn order, custom rules and etiquette lines
- Create, copy, rename, delete and reset, with confirmation on the destructive ones
- Saved data is validated on every load, so a hand-edited file cannot break the addon

**Announcing**
- Live preview of the exact chat messages, with byte counts and a time estimate
- Byte-safe splitting that never breaks a colour code, hyperlink or UTF-8 character
- Adjacent rules are packed into fewer messages
- Paced send queue with cancel, and channel availability checked before sending
- Say, yell, emote, party, raid, raid warning, instance, guild, officer, custom
  channels and whispers; new presets default to preview only

**Roll watcher**
- Adjudicates ordinary `/roll` results against the active preset
- Group, raid-subgroup, saved-roster and everyone filters
- Cross-realm name matching and locale-independent roll parsing
- Session log with per-name totals; verdicts optionally announced, rate-capped
- Always starts disarmed

**Sharing**
- Export and import presets as `REH1:` strings
- Imports are validated as untrusted input and confirmed before saving

**Interface**
- Main window with preset list, tabbed editors, live preview and announce controls
- Roll log window, transfer window, minimap button and addon compartment entry
- Options tab for colours, message packing, send delay and the minimap button

**Known gaps**
- Not yet loaded in the game: layout, sizing and clipping are unverified
- No broker (Titan/ElvUI datatext) plugin
- English only, though every string goes through the localization table
